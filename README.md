# customer-segmentation

This project focuses on customer segmentation, aiming to group customers with similar behaviors and enhance their understanding through effective segmentation techniques. Inspired by our own career journeys and recognizing natural similarities among individuals, we explore how these techniques can be applied to customer data analysis. Each stage of the segmentation process, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, classification algorithm selection, and model optimization, is thoroughly covered.

## Introduction

In the rapidly evolving landscape of data analysis and interpretation in business, this project emphasizes the importance of processing various data groups to increase the meaningful interpretation attributed to the data. The chosen focus arises from the desire to discover how similarities among individuals can lead to various outcomes. Customer segmentation is particularly emphasized to understand how similarities among people can enhance the effectiveness of campaigns targeted at customers. Despite appearing as a small and simple step, the significance of customer segmentation for companies is acknowledged.

### Dataset

The project utilizes a comprehensive customer dataset from a market, including demographic features, shopping behaviors, and marketing interactions. This dataset provides rich and multidimensional information, contributing to a deeper understanding of customers and the potential to offer more personalized and effective campaigns.

## Development

### Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a foundational step in any data analysis project, ensuring that data is prepared for analysis. In this project, several preprocessing steps were performed on the customer dataset. These processes focused on making the data more meaningful and suitable for analysis.

- The age of customers was derived from their birth year to facilitate demographic analysis.
- Uninformative columns, such as campaigns, were merged to provide a more comprehensive understanding.
- Textual data in columns like 'Education' and 'Marital_Status' was converted to numerical values for machine learning algorithms.

### Data Cleaning

Empty values were detected during data preprocessing, with particular attention to the 'Income' column. After an in-depth analysis, where no reliable method for filling missing 'Income' values was found, records with missing 'Income' were carefully removed to maintain the integrity and reliability of the analysis.
effectively reduce the dimensions of the dataset, revealing its fundamental structure. PCA's simplicity, efficiency, and ability to work without the need for outcome variables made it a preferred choice.

### Clustering

Various clustering models were considered, including KMeans, AgglomerativeClustering, and SpectralClustering. KMeans clustering was chosen for its simplicity, speed, and effective performance with a 3-cluster model.

## Conclusion

This study provides a comprehensive analysis of customer segmentation, offering valuable insights for companies to understand and target their customer base more effectively. The findings underscore the potential and importance of customer segmentation in improving decision-making processes and customer interactions. The proposed segmentation approaches provide valuable information for enhancing marketing strategies and deepening customer understanding. Overall, this project highlights the significance of customer segmentation for companies in optimizing their marketing efforts and gaining a competitive edge.
